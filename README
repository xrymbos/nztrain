== About

nztrain is an open source automarking system designed with IOI training in mind.

This revision is unstable, not ready for use.

== Setting Up

get ruby, rubygems, bundle, then type bundle in the project directory.

Build the sandbox in the moe directory (it's just one .c file) and put "box" in
the path somewhere. (atm this only works on 32 bit linux or something, plans to
expand in the future)

== Credits

Special thanks go to Margot who's super awesome support and enthusiasm drives
the entire New Zealand IOI scene. Without her, none of it would be (incl this)

Cheers to the aioc folk (esp bab + brb), orac was where we grew up and learned
all this stuff.

Then we've got greetz out to the Moe crew with their Moe Contest Environment
(we use their sandbox, box.c). It's part of their complete package for contests
at http://www.ucw.cz/moe/

Thanks out to the rails community (omfg your stuff is amazing) and whoever is
responsible for the existence of ruby (omfg your stuff is amazing) and jquery
(omfg your stuff is amazing) and jqueryui (omfg your stuff is amazing)
